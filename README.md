# **Assembly Image Converter**

## **Description**
The **Assembly Image Converter** is a project developed using **MARS Assembly Language** that converts images and binary files. It allows users to process image files and convert them into a format that can be handled in an assembly environment.

## **Features**
- **Converts image files** to binary format for assembly processing.
- **Supports reading and writing binary data** for image manipulation.
- **Handles different image formats** and converts them to assembly-compatible data.
- **Optimized for MARS** assembly with efficient binary handling.

## **Technologies Used**
- **MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)**: A tool for writing and simulating assembly language programs in MIPS architecture.
- **Assembly Language**: The code is written in MARS assembly to perform image-to-binary conversion.

## **How to Use**
1. **Download** the image file to convert.
2. **Load** the image file into the program.
3. **Run** the assembly program in MARS to convert the image into binary data.
4. **Output**: The binary data will be generated and saved in the specified format.

## **Installation**
To use this project, you need:
- **MARS Simulator**: Download and install the MARS assembler from [this link](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/).
- Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Assembly-ImageConverter.git

### Key Notes:
1. **Bold**: I've applied bold formatting for headings and important items (like `Description`, `Features`, `Technologies Used`).
2. **Bullet Points**: Used to list features and steps in a clear format.
3. **Code Blocks**: For command-line instructions or code snippets like cloning the repository.

You can copy and paste this into your `README.md` file on GitHub to make it clearer and well-structured. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
